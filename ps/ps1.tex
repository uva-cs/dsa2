Choose integer values for $n_0$ and $c$ that are low, or about as low, as possible.    \solution{    % Your solution here        }    \item Using the limit definitions, show which of the complexity classes $f(n) = 5n^3$ is in relative to $g(n)=8n^3 + n^2$.  In other words, show whether $f(n)=\Omega(g(n))$, and similarly for the other complexity classes ($O$, $\Theta$, $o$, $\omega$).    \solution{    % Your solution here        }\end{enumerate}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\begin{problem} Graph Representations \end{problem}Consider the following weighted digraph:    %%%%%%%%%%% START GRAPH    \vskip 2em    \begin{center}    \resizebox{.45\textwidth}{!}{\begin{tikzpicture}[->,>=stealth',shorten >=1pt,auto,node distance=3cm,thick,main node/.style={circle,fill=gray!10,draw,      font=\sffamily\Large\bfseries,minimum size=10mm}]      \node[main node] (a) {a};      \node[main node] (g) [left of=a] {g};      \node[main node] (b) [right of=a] {b};      \node[main node] (e) [above of=b] {e};      \node[main node] (d) [right of=b] {d};      \node[main node] (c) [above of=a] {c};      \node[main node] (f) [left of=c] {f};      \path[every node/.style={            fill=white,inner sep=2pt}]        (a) edge [] node[] {2} (b)            edge [] node[] {4} (c)        (b) edge [] node[] {8} (d)            edge [] node[] {4} (e)        (c) edge [] node[] {1} (f)            edge [] node[] {2} (e)        (d) edge [bend right] node[] {8} (e)            edge [bend left] node[] {8} (g)        (e) edge [bend right] node[] {7} (f)            edge [] node[] {4} (a)        (f) edge [] node[] {4} (g)        (g) edge [] node[] {3} (a)        ;    \end{tikzpicture}}\hfill    \end{center}    \hspace{2.2 in} Graph $G$    %%%%%%%%%%% END GRAPH    \begin{enumerate}    \item Show a representation of this graph using an adjacency matrix.
