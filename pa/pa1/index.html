<h3 id="reminder-policy-regarding-genai">Reminder: Policy Regarding GenAI</h3>
<p>This is a friendly reminder on the class policy regarding the use of GenAI on programming assignments in this course. While you may use GenAI to <strong>do the equivalent of looking up known information on the web / in a manual</strong>, you may <strong>NOT use GenAI to generate the solution to any part of this programming assignment</strong>. The purpose of the assignment is to practice your problem solving and programming implementation skills on your own. If we find that you have copied significant code generated by AI for this programming assignment, this will be considered an honor violation.</p>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>You are hired by the Disease Suppression Agency (DSA) to do contact tracing for a recent outbreak of Monday-itis. This is a serious disease! It apparently is quite infectious from one person to another.</p>
<p>The DSA folks have provided you with a list of contacts that people with Monday-itis have had, helping to indicate who transmitted it to whom. To help sort out the ordering, you have to write a program to determine the total pathogen load on a given individual in the contact trace.</p>
<p>Apparently there are multiple ways a person can come into contact with the Monday-itis pathogen (note that contacts are in a specific single direction only):</p>
<ul>
<li>First contact: this provides the largest pathogen load to the newly infected individual, and is when the infection starts. (tree edge)</li>
<li>Forward contact: this is when, for example, person A infects person B, person B infects person C, and then person A comes into contact with person C. This, also, causes a lower pathogen load. (forward edge)</li>
<li>Looped contact: this is when, for example, person A infects person B, then person B infects person C, and then person C comes into contact with person A. Since it is the same strain that person A had originally, the pathogen load is not as strong. (back edge)</li>
<li>Cross contact: this is when a person comes into contact with somebody that is not in their infection hierarchy at all. (cross edge)</li>
</ul>
<p>These types of contacts can be represented as the edges of a depth-first search – the edge types are listed in the list above. Each type of contact provides a different (integer) pathogen load to the individual. The amount of those pathogen loads are provided in each test case.</p>
<p>We will assume, for simplicity sake, that the DFS always proceeds in alphabetical order of the possible adjacent nodes.</p>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p>Consider the following contact trace graph:</p>
<p><img src="pa1.dot.svg" /></p>
<p>If we run DFS on it, starting at A, we get the following result. In the graph below, double edges are tree edges, dotted are forward edges, dashed are back edges, and bold edges are cross edges. Regular edges (the one from G to H) were not encountered in the DFS, which started at node A. Recall that when in a given node, we always process the outgoing edges alphabetically.</p>
<p><img src="pa1.dot.2.svg" /></p>
<p>Assume that the pathogen load for each type of contact is <span class="math inline">(10,5,3,4)</span> – this means 10 for an incoming tree edge, 5 for an incoming forward edge, 3 for an incoming back edge, and 4 for an incoming cross edge. The various nodes would have the following pathogen load:</p>
<ul>
<li>Node A: 0 (no incoming edges)</li>
<li>Node B: 10 (one incoming tree edge)</li>
<li>Node C: 22 (one of each type of incoming edge)</li>
<li>Node D: 17 (one incoming tree edge, one incoming cross edge, and one incoming back edge)</li>
<li>Node E: 10 (one incoming tree edge)</li>
<li>Node F: 10 (one incoming tree edge)</li>
<li>Node G: 0 (no incoming edges at all)</li>
<li>Node H: 0 (no incoming edges found in the DFS)</li>
</ul>
<p>If there is a node to which there is no path from the start node, such as nodes G and H in the graph above, then the answer is 0 (these were people that were not infected).</p>
<h3 id="input-description">Input description</h3>
<p>The first line of the input file will contain the total number of test cases <span class="math inline"><em>c</em></span> in the file, where <span class="math inline">1 ≤ <em>c</em> ≤ 10<sup>5</sup></span>.</p>
<p>Each test case will have exactly four lines:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first line will list the values for the pathogen load for each type of incoming edge, in the order: tree, forward, back, cross. These values will be positive integers <span class="math inline">1 ≤ <em>w</em><sub><em>t</em></sub>, <em>w</em><sub><em>f</em></sub>, <em>w</em><sub><em>b</em></sub>, <em>w</em><sub><em>c</em></sub> ≤ 10<sup>6</sup></span>.</li>
<li>The second line will list the number of vertices <span class="math inline">2 ≤ <em>v</em> ≤ 10<sup>9</sup></span>, and the number of edges <span class="math inline">1 ≤ <em>e</em> ≤ 10<sup>15</sup></span>.
<ul>
<li>NOTE: the value for <span class="math inline"><em>e</em></span> can exceed the maximum size of a typical <code>int</code>, so use a <code>long</code> (if appropriate for your programming language).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The next line will contain all of the edges in the graph. Each edge will contain a space separated pair of node names. Each pair will also be separated by a space. Thus, there will be <span class="math inline">2<em>v</em></span> strings on this line.
<ul>
<li>All node names are alpha-numeric strings of length <span class="math inline">1 ≤ <em>l</em> ≤ 32</span>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The last line will contain two nodes: the first, <span class="math inline"><em>s</em></span>, is the start node (aka patient zero), and the second is the node for which the pathogen load will be output.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="output-description">Output description</h3>
<p>For each test case, the (single) integer pathogen load of the designated node should be output. Any given output value may exceed the size of an <code>int</code>, but will fit into a <code>long</code>.</p>
<h3 id="sample-input">Sample input</h3>
<p>The input below, for all four test cases, corresponds to the graph above. The only difference is the node to print the pathogen load for – it is nodes C, D, F, and H, respectively. This input is provided in the <a href="example.in">example.in</a> file.</p>

<h3 id="skeleton-code">Skeleton Code</h3>
<p>We are providing skeleton code for this assignment. You should start with <a href="pa1.py.html">pa1.py</a> or <a href="PA1.java.html">PA1.java</a>. This code reads in the input described above.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-notes">Implementation notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>When you submit your code, the test case shown above will be run to ensure your program is handling the input and output correctly.</li>
<li>You should <strong><em>NOT</em></strong> represent your graph as an adjacency matrix, as there will not be enough memory for some of the graphs that we will provide for testing.</li>
<li>Some of the values above will require a <code>long</code> type for some programming languages (C, C++, Java, etc.). Other languages (Python) will not need to worry about this.</li>
<li>You need to implement DFS yourself – you cannot use a library function for DFS.</li>
<li>We will never provide you with invalid input, so you do not need to error check the input values provided.</li>
<li>Although you are not graded on the speed of your program’s execution, it has to run in the expected DFS running time of <span class="math inline"><em>Θ</em>(<em>V</em>+<em>E</em>)</span>, else it will time out with some of the larger test cases.</li>
<li>The values for each contact given (10, 5, 3, and 4) are not the ones used in the grading tests, so be sure to use the values provided by the input, and do not hard code the 10/5/3/4 values.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="submission">Submission</h3>
<p>The submission system can handle four different programming languages, although only two have skeleton code provided (Python and Java). For each programming language, the name of the submitted file is listed below (you have to have it named that exact name, else it will not compile properly). If you want to program in a different language, email the course email at least three days before it is due (as we have to reconfigure the autograder).</p>
<ul>
<li>Python 3: pa1.py</li>
<li>Java: PA1.java</li>
<li>C: pa1.c</li>
<li>C++: pa1.cpp</li>
</ul>
<p>You will submit your completed source code file to Gradescope. There will be a <em>small set</em> of acceptance tests that are <strong><em>NOT COMPREHENSIVE</em></strong>. These acceptance tests are the test cases in the <a href="example.in">example.in</a> file. It’s up to you to comprehensively test your code. The acceptance tests just verify that you are reading the input correctly and providing the expected output.</p>
<p>Note that when you submit, Gradescope will report your grade as “-/10” or “0/10” – that’s a quirk of Gradescope, and is because the grading tests have not been run (and won’t be run until after all submissions are in). YOu can look at the results of the individual test cases to see how your program worked</p>
