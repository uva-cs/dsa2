## Tuesday, February 25th: Warm-up


**Imagine a world without computerized cash registers!**

*The problem:* Given unlimited quantities of pennies, nickles, dimes, and quarters (worth 1, 5, 10, and 25 cents, respectively), design an algorithm to determine a set of coins (the *change*) for a given value $x$ using the fewest number of coins.
